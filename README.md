# Welcome to My Professional Development Site!     

## Introduction
Welcome to my professional development website's repository! I decided to start this project as a way to showcase the skills and technologies that I've learned while working at my current job, as well as to try out some new languages and tools outside of work. While the main page of the site will have some resume/about me information, there will also be links to a blog articles that I'll write throughout this journey and to a personal project that I work on outside of my 9-5. 

### The blog
Personally, I learn best by teaching so I've decided to blog the progress I make while building out the features of this website and while working on my pet project <a href="https://github.com/kurtispinkney/WxProject">WxProject</a> (creative name, I know). The focus of the articles will be two-fold. One set of articles will be documenting my journey learning Javascript via the ReactJS web framework and NodeJS runtime environment. The other articles will focus on the tools/technologies that I will use to build out WxProject. 

### WxProject
<a href="https://github.com/kurtispinkney/WxProject">WxProject</a> is something I hope to make available to the weather community that helped to launch my professional career. The premise of the project is to create a platform where a user can download various raw weather datasets by highlighting weather phenomenon that are being displayed on a map.
